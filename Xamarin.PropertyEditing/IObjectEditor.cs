		 * Dealing with async values in the context of what's possible across all target platforms is a bit complex.
		 * While implicit safety may be able to be ensured, it would be exhaustive to reason it out and could change
		 * at any moment, so we need an explicit safety strategy. As we make value gets and sets async, we open ourselves
		 * to race conditions even on just the UI thread. Value changes can come from the user, or from the object editor
		 * at any point. So, we break these changes into two categories: Blocking UI & Waiting Values.
		 *
		 * Anything that needs to deal with the current state of the values will Wait asynchronously on prior changes to
		 * finish. These largely involve value changes from the object editor, which just acts as a INPC and does not
		 * contain the value itself, so it will be safe and the latest value when queried upon reaching active state in
		 * the wait queue (see AsyncWorkQueue). Selected objects (when >1) need to wait on values as they need to be
		 * able to calculate the intersection values.
		 *
		 * Anything that needs to deal with user input will need to block its UI. We simply can't reason about the user
		 * changing values while waiting for previous changes, because they value they're changing may change underneath
		 * them or become invalid as a result of a prior pending change.
